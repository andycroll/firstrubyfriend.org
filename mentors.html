									q="But I’m way too early in my career to offer advice"
									a="Imagine how useful it would have been to have someone a year or two into their career, who has just been through interviews and the fear of starting a new job. Someone with a similar starting point to you. Still think you have nothing to offer? You do."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="I’m sure I’d be terrible."
									a="You don't really know something until you’ve tried to explain it to someone. This is good for you too!"
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="What should we talk about?"
									a="You should let your mentee lead the conversation. And encourage them to ask whatever they want."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="How honest should I be?"
									a="There’s no point in doing this if you aren’t going to be honest. That said, remember an early career developer might lack context or have less confidence than you. So have empathy as well as honesty."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="Should I let my manager at work know about this?"
									a="Yes. You’re unlikely to get any “work credit” directly for it, but I would hope any good manager would encourage their direct reports to work on improving their mentoring skills."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="When will I hear about my match?"
									a="I’ll be shipping cohorts of matches at the beginning of each month for the folks who submitted applications the month before."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="How long does this programme last?"
									a="We’re expecting half-hour long monthly calls, for six months. If you (in agreement with your mentee) want to go for longer or shorter, or meet more often, go for it. But the base expectation is six half-hour calls over six months."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="How should we meet?"
									a="Primarily I’d expect folks to meet using Zoom, Google Meet, Tuple or FaceTime. There might be cases where in person meetings might be possible, but distinctly not required."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="What are the criteria for matching folks up?"
									a="We’ll take a couple of factors into account including the preferences of the applicant. Primarily we’ll use work experience and geography."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="What if my match doesn’t respond or disappears?"
									a="We’ll be sending out reminders to both parties so hopefully this won't happen. If it does, never fear, if you’re willing we’ll match you with someone new in the next cohort."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="What if it doesn’t work out?"
									a="Sometimes you just don’t gel with someone new. That’s OK and either party can stop the process at any time. If it’s jut a time pressure thing I really implore you to finish up your commitment. It is only three hours total."
							%}
							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="Can I mentor more than one person?"
									a="In theory, yes. In practice, I love your enthusiasm but let’s just chill. I want to start this slowly and sustainably for everyone. Let’s all start with a small commitment."
