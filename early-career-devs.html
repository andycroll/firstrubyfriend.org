								include faq.html
									q="Should I let my manager at work know about this?"
									a="You can, no need for it to be a secret. You may have a mentor or buddy, as well as a line manager in your workplace. This of this as another usful viewpoint."

								include faq.html
									q="When will I hear about my match?"
									a="I’ll be shipping cohorts of matches at beginning of each month for the folks who submitted applications the month before. It'll be first-come, first-served, but I’ll prioritise those from under-represented groups."

									q="How long does this programme last?"
									a="We’re expecting half-hour long monthly calls, for six months. If you (in agreement with your mentee) want to go for longer or shorter, or meet more often, go for it. But the base expecation is six half-hour calls over six months."

									q="How should we meet?"

							{% 
								include faq.html
									q="What if my mentor doesn’t respond or disappears?"
