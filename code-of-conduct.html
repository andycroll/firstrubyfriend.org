		<div class="mx-auto pb-12 prose">
			<p>We’re committed to creating a safe community for new Rubyists to grow as developers. As such, all participants and organizers are expected to treat each other with respect and kindness. This code of conduct outlines the expected behavior of all folks invovled in this programme and will be enforced.</p>
			
			<h2>Harassment</h2>
			<p>Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassing behavior includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments related to one’s identity (race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc.), unwelcome sexual advances or physical touching, stalking, mean-spirited behavior, or disruption.</p>
			<p>Any participant who engages in harassment will be immediately removed from the community, including being expelled from any calls and blocked on all social media platforms.</p>
			
			<h2>Matz is Nice And So We Are Nice (MINASWAN)</h2>
			<p>Not all unwelcoming behavior is harassment. Many tech spaces are rife with more subtle forms of exclusionary behavior. While harder to identify, these behaviors can still be harmful to a community, especially to its newest members, who are still finding their feet. It is important that we go above and beyond to treat each other with kindness and dignity. As the saying goes, Matz Is Nice, And So We Are Nice.</p>
			
			<p>As an illustration here’s two of the Recurse Center’s Social Rules:</p>
			
			<h4>No “well-actually”s (or other gatekeep-y behavior)</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p><b>Jackie:</b> I just learned how to use the Ruby pluck method!</p>
				<p><b>Tricia:</b> Well actually, that’s a Rails method.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Correcting others when it’s not necessary or relevant is a form of gatekeeping.</p>
			<p>This can be really harmful to folk erly in their career and discourage them from pursuing a career in tech altogether. This is hte opposite of what we’re trying to achieve!</p>
			<p>That said there may be cases in an "experience sharing" mentorship relationship where differing events within our industry might mean opinions are different. In those cases it is important to be civil, empathetic and realise you might be wrong, even if you have many years more experience.</p>

			<h4>No subtle <i>-isms</i></h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p><b>Madison:</b> I’m having trouble installing Ruby 3.</p>
				<p><b>Cate:</b> rbenv is so easy, even your grandma could use it!</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Even if you’re not engaging in outright racist, sexist, homophobic, or other exclusionary behavior, the words you use can indirectly express these sentiments to the people around you.</p>
			<p>It’s important to be mindful of the ways in which oppression is baked into the language we use every day and try our best to use language that is inclusive and uplifting.</p>
			
			<h3>If you make a mistake</h3>
			<p>Nobody is perfect, and we will all make mistakes. If you have inadvertently said something hurtful to other members of the community, it is important to apologize as soon as possible and to educate yourself so as not to repeat the same behavior. Similarly, if you see someone engaging in microaggressions, let them (or the organizers) know so they have the opportunity to learn from their mistake.</p>
			<p>One-off, accidental instances of hurtful language will not be considered harassment, and the organizer will do their best to mediate smaller conflicts. However, repeated or intentional incidents will be considered harassment and are grounds for removal from this programme.</p>
			
			<h2>Reporting and Enforcement</h2>
			<p>If you witness a violation to this code of conduct either during a meeting or within the community (e.g. email or Twitter), please contact organizer Andy Croll at <a href="mailto:andy@goodscary.com">andy@goodscary.com</a>. Swift action will be taken to enforce the code of conduct, including mediating more minor conflicts or removing individuals from the community entirely.</p>
			
			<h2>Accessibility</h2>
			<p>The organizers are committed to meeting the accessibility needs of all participants.</p>
			<p>If there is any way we can improve the accessibility of our programme to meet your needs, please email the organizer Andy Croll at <a href="mailto:andy@goodscary.com">andy@goodscary.com</a>.
